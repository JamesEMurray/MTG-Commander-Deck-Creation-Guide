<p>
    Hello and a warm welcome to whomever happens to be reading this. My name is James Evan Murray, pen-name J.E.M and I’m an author of the Fantasy genre and one of the tale tellers.
    My writing exploits began when I was six years old, when I sat down to write a Scooby Doo story entitled “The Mysteryous Hotle”, and no, spelling was not my forte back then.
    It was about, as you may have guessed, a mysterious hotel where not everything was as it seemed, hallways which were really giant treadmills, ghost that were jack-o-lanterns
    covered by bedsheets and a disfigured receptionist, who had become so accustomed to being called a monster, that he decided to embrace it. I made it to chapter sixteen, but was
    reluctant to bring the adventure to an end, wanting it to go on and on forever, and so the project was put to one side. </p>

<p>
    At the age of eight, I went from writing about adventures with the gang, to fantastical, magical tales with characters of my own; Such as Jack The Pumpkin Slayer, Sword Thief and Marco Merlin
    to name but a few. My imagination ran riot in those years and I never remained on one project long enough to complete it, although I did make it a good three long chapters into “The Story of 
    The Tree of Life” a novel I still intend to write. It is about a DnD-esque party of adventurers travelling the world and slaying the five great beasts who represent the five pillars of Hell,
    a radical, yet awesome story idea I think you’ll agree. </p>

<p>
    For now however, at the grand old age of seventeen, I have set about writing my first trilogy, that I intent to publish in a couple of years time. The first book of the
    “Tragedy to Tranquility Trilogy: From Gutter to Godhood” is well on its way to completion, although my lavish love of lengthy alliteration may have to sadly be set aside, 
    as book one has become a tad too long and I fear may have to be split in two. Never mind, the book is set in The Twin Worlds, so I suppose it makes sense. </p>

<p>
    Till then, if you want to find out more about me and my writing, I am the proud author of the Tale Teller Blogs, that you can find posted on this here website. 
    If that’s still not enough for you and you prefer soothing sanguine sounds, rather than wryly written words, I suggest you check out my YouTube channel ‘Jemstone’, 
    where you can find short stories I have written, read to you, by me, in the form of an audiobook or radio broadcast. Sometimes structured and sometimes written with 
    the added wonder of rolling dice, randomly determining where the story goes -a nod to my tabletop gaming hobby- I’m sure you’ll find it intriguing, if not entertaining, 
    thanks to the added comical charm randomness and chaos brings. If you’re interested in the creation process, you will be pleased to know, that I have also uploaded videos 
    showing the character creation process. All this and more can be found on my YouTube channel, but for those of you interested specifically in the tales being told, 
    the “James’ Journal” playlist is the place to go. Self centred ramble over, I am afraid dear readers, that now I must go, for, in the words of The Tale Teller, 
    “There is always, another tale, to be told.” </p>

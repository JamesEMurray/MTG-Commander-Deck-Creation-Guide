<h2>Step 3: Creating A Land/Mana Base</h2>
<p> Now that you have selected your commander, it is time to move on to the mana base. </p>
<p> Now, depending on who you ask you will be given very different answers as to how many lands you should put in your commander deck. Answers vary wildly, 
    ranging from 20-45 being declared as the amount of lands one should have in their commander deck. Personally, my advice would be 25 lands for most decks,
    adding more for 3 colour decks and up to 40 for lands-matter decks, lands-matter decks meaning, decks that contain a lot of permanents that trigger their 
    effects when you play lands. </p>
<p> The next question to be answered, is what kind of lands do you add? <br> Well, that is highly dependant on the deck that you are building, but in general, 
    you want at least 5 lands that tap for any of your colours, 10 lands that tap for
    at least two of your colours and 2 lands that do beneficial things other than just tap for mana, the remainder being basic lands of the appropriate type. </p>
